Annotation,Explanation
"I know that your nigga came witcha
 But he ain’t witcha","In this line, Frank points out how he notices this person who he’s interested in arrived to the function with their man, but after arriving, they separate and they’re not together at this point of the night. The second line could also indicate that Frank notices that despite the fact these two people arrived together, they’re not really romantically involved, in a sense that the two people are together, but very loosely, and are possibly distant."
"You got a roommate, he’ll hear what we do
 It’s only awkward if you’re fucking him too","Society today is so untruthful to each other, that Frank struggles to maintain an intimate moment without thinking that the person he is having this moment with is also having sex with his/her roommate.

This thought from Frank isn’t met with any reassurance (the verse ends after these lines), much like in today’s society. People today can never be sure if their partner treats their shared moments with the same importance as they do. Creating divide and trust issues, two of the prevailing themes on Blonde.

Frank also may be addressing his own bisexual tendencies, possibly implying that he is having sex with her roommate who is male."
"He don’t care for me, but he cares for me
 And that’s good enough","The “mermaid”, Frank’s drug dealing cousin’s girlfriend, is resigned to the fact that her boyfriend isn’t really invested in the relationship and is content that he takes care of her even if his heart really isn’t in it.

These lines may also be referring to the previous line “punk madre, punk papa”. Her parents don’t care for her but still provide and raise her, so she accepts it."
Weed crumbles into glitter,"When marijuana is broken up (either by hand or in a grinder), it often leaves a shiny residue of kief, a cannabinoid resin. Viewed in quantity, it resembles glitter.



It’s also interesting to note that Frank’s Snapchat username is “arealglitterboy.”"
[Verse 3: KOHH],"This closing verse, performed by Japanese rapper KOHH, is only featured on the CD that was included in the version of the Boys Don’t Cry magazine that was given away at various pop up shops on the day Blonde was released.






一人の男
たくさんかわいい女の子
誰かのことを 誰も縛れはしない
他人の心
まあ、飲みたいならお酒でも飲もう（ふぉ）
彼女がいたり、彼氏がいたり
気の合っちゃう人間２人
しょうがない
男たちと 女たち
去るもの追わず
来るもの選ぶ
それだけの話
今しかない時間
大事にしな
何億万人も
いい人ならいるよ
あの子がまたモデルの子に嫉妬
でも好きなら好き
無理なら無理だし
次から次に （次に）
類が友を呼んでくれるいつも （類が友を呼ぶ）
たまには離れてみるのも必要 （必要…必要…）
自由にする まるでパリスヒルトン (パリスヒルトン)




English translation of verse:


One guy
A lot of cute girls
You can’t tie down someone else
Another person’s heart
If you feel like drinking then let’s get some drinks
Even if she got a man, even if he got a girl
When two people meet and hit it off
That’s just how it is
Guys and girls
They don’t chase after the past
They choose from what’s in front of them
That’s all I’m saying

You only get one chance (Literally: “This time only exists now”)
Don’t take it for granted
There are millions of people out there
You’ll find the person for you
That girl gets jealous over another model again
But if you love her then you love her
If it isn’t working out then it isn’t working out
Moving on from one to another
Birds of a feather always flock together
Sometimes you just have to stand back and let them live
Be free like Paris Hilton

"Sippin’ pink-gold lemonades
 Feelin’","Pink gold would make an amber rose-type color; Frank makes a play on words with the previous line about Amber and the amber golden color.

Pink & Gold Lemonades could be a reference to a golden alcohol drink or spirit mixed with pink lemonade. The lemonade may be lean which is pink. Pink is a slang term for cough syrup due to the purple or pinkish hue. In the video, Frank can be seen sipping from a styrofoam cup usually used for mixing lean.

Earlier in the first verse, Frank pays homage to two figures in rap who both overdosed from cough syrup, Pimp C & A$AP Yams.

Pour up for A$AP (rest in peace)
RIP Pimp C (rest in peace)

The gold is a reference to gold yellow colored Hydrocodone Syrup. Frank’s vocals are slowed throughout the track in a chopped and screwed Houston style Pimp C type sound."
"We only human and it’s humid in these Balmains
 I mean my balls sticking to my jeans","Frank is sweating in expensive Balmain jeans, a French fashion house that produces clothing for high-end department stores like Barneys.  He may be alluding to wanting to take off those pants to get frisky with his companion which ties into the previous lines: “I know that your nigga came with you. But he ain’t with you. We only human…”



Balmain’s current Creative Director, Olivier Rousteing, designed the jumpsuit Frank wears in the “Nikes” videos for this verse as revealed through the brand’s official Instagram page."
[Verse 2: Frank Ocean],"From this point of the song onward, the pitch-shifted vocals are gone, and it’s Frank’s real voice. The shift to his “real” voice from that of an artificially altered one, mirrors a shift that occurs in the lyrics.

The first verse features materialistic characters of questionable morals and discusses the artificial parts of life—Nikes sneakers, partying, checks. The second verse featuring Frank’s real voice is the more emotionally and lyrically complex of the two.

As Frank explained in an interview with the New York Times, he uses the different vocal pitches to sing as a different version of himself. It is possible the higher pitch represents him when he was younger, when he was more focused on material possessions and this verse, represents his current mentality."
"We out by the pool, some little mermaids
 Me and them gel like twigs with them bangs","A possible reference to FKA twigs and her trademark, quirky hairstyles, which appear to utilise the power of hair gel. Frank has even reblogged one of her looks on his Tumblr.



Mermaids exist in water, so being by the pool is their natural environment. Frank has a connection with them, whether that be via drugs or sex."
"I don’t play, I don’t make time
 But if you need dick, I got you
 And I yam from the line","The person Frank is singing about (today’s society) is not feigning emotion and putting in the effort for quality time, this is a strictly physical exchange. People today are not interested in making up the time to form relationships with people, only quick and forgotten intimate moments.

In basketball, a “yam” is a particularly powerful slam dunk and the “line” refers to the free throw line, somewhere only a few gifted athletes have ever dunked from.

Dunking is also a slang term for sex, so Frank uses this sports metaphor to show his prowess as a lover. Not only can he “dunk” from the free throw line, but he emphatically “yams” it. “Yams” are also a colloquial reference to a vagina.

This was posted on Frank’s Tumblr:
http://frankocean.tumblr.com/post/79349356099

Yams is also a reference to A$AP mob co-founder A$AP Yams, who is mentioned in the next line."
"In the halls of your hotel
 Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
 How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
 We had time to kill back then","If this song is about Frank and another man, it’s significant because it’s a public display of affection between two young, closeted people.
Frank’s lover’s willingness to put their relationship on display, would have felt like a deep expression of love and faith.

These lines tie in well with the reflective nature of this sing, and shows that their relationship was temporary – a rush of love, great memories made, and beautiful new feelings ultimately faded with age. He and the other person matured in their own ways, now simply viewing it all as “good times”. His time with them is like the time one spends in a hotel during vacation. It’s a temporary trip away from your normal life, often because you’re visiting a foreign environment, experiencing what that new place has to offer."
"I broke your heart last week
 You’ll probably feel better by the weekend
 Still remember, had you going crazy
 Screamin’ my name, the feeling deep down is good","Frank notes how quickly (two weeks) the song’s subject is able to recover from a heartbreak.

While the sexual feeling was intense, the subject’s feelings turned out to be superficial, seeing as they were able to quickly shed the attachment and get over Frank. This may symbolize how fast a relationship can grow and self-destruct: what was once seen as a perfect moment is nothing more than just a memory now. Frank’s partner can only move on with life because that’s all they can do."
"You ain’t a kid no more, we’ll never be those kids again
 It’s not the same, ivory’s illegal, don’t you remember?","Frank and the person he’s singing about have grown up and grew apart. While they’ll “never be those kids again,” Frank keeps that memory as a piece of their relationship.

Ivory, a hard, white material obtained from elephant tusks was banned in 1989 due to the rapidly decreasing elephant population, but before that, was used to make luxury drug accessories. Ivory is also slang for cocaine, Frank may be saying that their love affair involved some long nights on cocaine, and have become more aware of the legal repercussions of it as they grew older. He’s essentially saying that their love was a product of their reckless youth and was heightened by drugs, but now that they’ve grown up it will forever remain just a perfect memory.



Ivory also has an off-white color, which may be referring to a tainted innocence since white has a positive connotation of purity and cleanliness.

The use of the term, “ivory” is most likely an intentional use of wordplay that ties the song together. The ivy plant is an invasive species, while ivory is something precious. This could show the duality of the relationship and how it went from something precious to something toxic or invasive like ivy."
"All the things I didn’t mean to say, I didn’t mean to do
 There were things you didn’t need to say, did you mean to? Mean to?
 I’ve been dreamin’ of you, dreamin’ of you
 I’ve been dreamin’ of you, dreamin’ of you
 I’ve been dreamin’, dreamin’","Frank is overcome with emotion and regret about what happened between him and his former lover. It’s possible that this monologue has taken place while Frank is lying in bed, half-asleep and dreaming of this old lover, fitting with the gauze of the shoe-gaze guitars that are draped over the song.

As Frank becomes angered and begins to scream, his voice becomes altered by the grain delay. The scream, delivered almost as a crescendo, is a culmination of emotions and represents Frank’s deep longing and heartache. By the end of the song, he expresses his frustration physically and breaks the other objects around him."
"I thought that I was dreamin’ when you said you love me
 The start of nothin’
 I had no chance to prepare, I couldn’t see you comin’
 The start of nothin’
 Ooh, I could hate you now
 It’s quite alright to hate me now
 When we both know that deep down
 The feeling still deep down is good","Frank describes the beginning of a now failed relationship. In this reflective line, the words “the start of nothing” point to the relationship being doomed from the start – although he was blissfully unaware at the beginning. Overtime, both parties ended up hurting each other and as a result, Frank believes he can hate them for changing the good friendship that they once had into something he wasn’t ready for.

Furthermore, he could mean by having “no time to prepare” that he wanted to be a better version of himself before the relationship started. But because they jumped into this unexpected love affair, perhaps he still had internal issues he was dealing with, and ended up hurting the other person as a result.

“The start of nothing” also sounds similar to “it started from nothing”. This re-enforces that he was overwhelmed when his partner told him they loved him—he wasn’t emotionally prepared. Perhaps, this relationship blossomed from a long time friendship, and here the friend tells him that they intimately love him. The relationship burgeoned out of nowhere then became more serious but they eventually separated all the same, destroying the friendship they had too."
We’d drive to Syd’s,"This is a nod to one of Frank’s good friends, Syd tha Kid, lead singer of the neo-RnB group The Internet and former member of Odd Future.

Syd and Taco’s house was the place where Odd Future members used to hang out. Frank relishes in the memories of simpler times and just messing around with his friends."
"Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
 We didn’t give a fuck back then
 I ain’t a kid no more
 We’ll never be those kids again","Frank and the person he’s singing about have grown up and apart. Back when he was younger, Frank could go through life “armored” against the hurt. But now that he’s matured, he is feeling it all—the consequences of his actions, the hole left in his life by the absence of this lover. The mistakes we make as kids may not kill us in the moment, but we tend to pay for them later with regret and sorrow.

Like an armored truck, the emotional walls Frank put up when he was younger were hard to get past—he didn’t let this person fully in. While this made him safer, it may be the reason why their relationship ended.

Frank may also be referencing the now-dissolved group he was once a part of, Odd Future, which leads into the next line, referencing another former member Syd. The group’s leader, Tyler, the Creator had once called the group as “kids fucked up in their mental.”"
"If I could see through walls, I could see you’re faking
 If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces","“Seeing through walls” means to see someone clearly for what they are—beyond the emotional barriers they may put up to prevent further heartache. The person Frank is addressing isn’t being true to themselves or their relationship with Frank. This leads Frank to fantasize about having them back in his life.

Frank juxtaposes the hidden feelings he and his lover are hiding behind physical and metaphorical emotional barriers. While his lover is static behind a  “wall” that seems to be permanently obscuring the truth, Frank’s own emotional barrier is dynamic and impermanent in nature. There also appears to be a contrast between how the person could be faking whereas Frank is almost hiding his feelings altogether, exhibiting that there is insecurity in this relationship."
"Had the X6 back then, back then","In a 2012 interview, Tyler, The Creator commented: “I remember Frank had a nice ass car and would always take us places.” It seems Frank’s car may have been the BMW X6 SUV crossover. The X6 premiered with its first model in 2009, so “back then” was at least that recent.



In his NYT profile, it’s revealed that Frank keeps at minimum 3 Beemers at the ready.

He rents three parking spots for three different BMWs.

In addition, he was having a “vintage 1990 BMW E30 sedan [be] rebuilt to his exact specifications,” much like the one featured on the cover of his mixtape nostalgia, ULTRA."
"No matter what I did, my waves wouldn’t dip back then
 Everything sucked back then, we were friends","Waves are a hairstyle formed by brushing and laying down the curls in the hair into a curl pattern. Wavers commonly refer to a nice wave pattern as dipping.



Frank uses “waves” to draw parallels of the pre-success and pre-loss-of-innocence period in his life with his current successful, morbidly real situation. Frank points out how simple things didn’t go his way back then, continuing the reflective theme of the song as Frank looks back on his younger, innocent days.

“Waves” are also an analogy to everything valuable to that person. Since a person can not force a “dip” – a successful relationship – in such a short amount of time, Frank expresses how his partner has lost hope."
"Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob
 Say what up to Danny","The names here are in reference to the characters from Frank’s “Godspeed Script” from page 51 of the Boys Don’t Cry magazine. In the script, Frank lists Steely (not named in this song) as the main protagonist, Shoobie (shortened to ‘Shoob’ in these lyrics) as his girlfriend, and Matthew/Danny (both also named in these lyrics) as Steely’s childhood friends."
[Intro],"The riff heard here is actually the same as one from Tyler the Creator’s 2011 track B.S.D.

it can be heard from 0:13-0:14

not sure if it’s coincidental but it was pretty cool to hear"
"It’s the same way you showed me
 Nod my head, don’t close my eyes
 Halfway on a slow move
 It’s the same way you showed me","Frank notes that this person taught him how to accept that he cannot impose his will upon the world. With their help, he learns to embrace the things he can’t control, including his love for this song’s muse. That’s also shown in the line “Nod my head, don’t close my eyes,” where he is taught to say yes to things more instead of being afraid of what you can’t control.

The lines “nod my head, don’t close my eyes / Halfway on a slow move” may also be references to cunnilingus. She showed him how she likes it, and to look at her instead of closing his eyes when he’s going down on her. It leads well into the next line about going south too. This is some subtle imagery tied back into the “Pink” part of the song’s title."
"Bending up my Nikes
 Running out of melpomene, nicotine
 Stealing granny cigs (Take it easy)","The Melpomene projects are located in New Orleans. Frank lived in NOLA until Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005 and moved to L.A shortly after.

“Bending up my Nikes” refers to the  toe-crease you get when you wear the same shoes regularly.



Interestingly, “Melpomene” was also originally the Greek muse of singing, eventually becoming the muse of Tragedy while “Nike” was the Greek goddess of strength speed and victory,  making a double meaning to bending the same way wings bend when the goddess is flying. Once again this shows a duality of life and victory with death and tragedy and also references the first song of the album ‘'Nikes’‘."
"Nosedive into flood lines
 Tall tower of milk crates
 It’s the same way you showed me
 Cannonball off the porch side
 Older kids trying off the rooves
 Just the same way you showed me (You showed)","Frank again references Hurricane Katrina and the flooding it caused, talking about how he witnessed people swimming in the flood waters, seemingly making the best out of the ungovernable. The “nose-dive” and “tall tower” create an exhilarating sense of climbing and jumping from a height. It was a moment in time where the world above was something to embrace, even though after that moment it’s all downhill from there.

Frank brings this back to the person he is singing about, the person who “showed him love,” creating another level of metaphor here for “diving in” to life, and to their relationship.

This is also a euphemism for doing cocaine. In the wake of tragedies such as Hurricane Katrina people often take refuge in taking “nose dives” into “lines” and “tall towers” of white. He’s learned to turn to cocaine in times of trouble just like his ex-girlfriend taught him.

This may call back to an interview that Frank did with Wax Poetics back in 2012 in which he talked about experiencing floods during his childhood:

All the houses in New Orleans are raised off the ground because of floods and shit. So it was like three feet of water. My cousins and I stacked up milk crates and were using it as a diving board into the floodwaters. We were doing that all day until one of my neighbors came out there on a little swamp-style boat, and grabbed a water moccasin out of the water and cut its head off against the fence."
"If you could fly, then you’d feel south
 Up north’s getting cold soon
 The way it is, we’re on land
 Still, I’m someone to hold true","These lines reference birds' instincts to migrate south before winter hits to avoid the cold weather. However, Frank is not a bird. He embraces his bonds to the Earth and connects his contentment with his sedentary lifestyle to his commitment to this person. Frank will keep his loved one warm.

Similarly to the lines that open the verse, these lyrics are referenced in the “Godspeed” screenplay included in Frank’s Boys Don’t Cry magazine. At the end of Scene 1:

Steely looks down at his feet, and there’s ice on the grass though it’s simmer. Steely pulls his head up to say ‘snow’ but doesn’t even make the beginning sounds of the word. A single ball of alloy, white and coated with ice, spins around them like a tether ball to its poll. Shoobie still mouthing the words to a song playing in her head. ‘If you could fly then you’d feel south, up north’s gettin’ cold soon…The way it is we’re on land — still I’m someone to hold true'.

Feeling “south” is also a way to say that things haven’t gone well. For example, if something goes “south,” it is not going well. However, the line is a bit of a paradox (perhaps intentionally). Saying that if you could “fly,” then you would not be happy. Not feeling content with “flying” could emphasize the lack of control we have over anything, a theme of the verse."
"Gimme something sweet
 Bitch, I might like immortality
 This is life, life immortality","Throughout the outro, Frank talks about moments when life was unburdened, and they lived without restraints. It’s a nostalgic view back on a part of his youth. These moments survive in his memories, and achieve a kind of immortality despite the time itself already having passed.

This resolves the tension that has been created throughout the verses and hooks. The love that Frank’s spoken of, just like life, will inevitably end because that IS life. But his lover gave him the gift of being able to accept that, of being able to enjoy the present and the past just for “how it was.” They’ve given him heaven on Earth, a feeling of what immortality means."
"That’s the way every day goes
 Every time we’ve no control
 If the sky is pink and white
 If the ground is black and yellow","These lines are referenced in Frank’s Boys Don’t Cry magazine, in his “Godspeed” screenplay (pages 50-55).  In the screenplay, Steely’s girlfriend Schoobie recites these lyrics:

Shoobie: (Bobbing her head to music that isn’t playing, she sings)
‘That’s the way every day goes, every time we’ve no control…’ (Page 51)

Color is a significant motif in Frank’s music, from the title of his 2012 album channel ORANGE to symbolistic songs like “Eyes Like Sky” and “Pink Matter.” He specifically mentions pink skies in “Sierra Leone.” Here, Frank expresses how we have no control over the color of the sky, it can be blue, or it can be pink and white.



The “black and yellow” ground calls to mind the image of the black asphalt and the yellow painted lines of the street.

This may also be connecting to Hurricane Katrina, which Frank alludes to in the second verse, in reference to an old proverb, “Red sky in the morning, sailors take warning”. He’s essentially using the notion that “we have no control” over the color of the sky as a way of coming to terms with what happened during the hurricane."
"Just the same way you showed me, showed me
 You showed me love
 Glory from above
 Regard, my dear
 It’s all downhill from here","Frank’s reached a high, but this is the pinnacle of their relationship—the pair can only go downhill. However, “downhill” could mean that their relationship will be easy from here. “Uphill” is going to be difficult/hard, and that the hard part is over and it’s all smooth sailing from here on.

Frank says, “Just the same way you showed me love,” recalling the situations in the verse where his lover showed him how to embrace things that weren’t controllable. Frank extrapolates this to include their relationship’s end.

Frank’s song “Golden Girl,” shares a similar story. Frank sings:

If we build a house in paradise, will we get to heaven still?
If we don’t have to live through hell just to get to heaven
I'mma stay right here, with you
Til the hurricane comes, ‘til the tsunami comes

In both situations, a moment of happiness is accompanied by the sense that the destruction of that happiness is inevitable.

Here, the affection Frank receives from his lover is perceived as “Glory from above,” or from God, but the feeling can’t last for mere mortals. Frank acknowledges this more explicitly in the outro, singing “This is life, life immortality.”"
"If you could die and come back to life
 Up for air from the swimming pool
 You’d kneel down to the dry land
 Kiss the earth that birthed you
 Gave you tools just to stay alive
 And make it out when the sun is ruined","Frank closes the second verse with an ode to his mother, describing the love between a mother and her child. She helped him through tough times (drowning in life’s complexities) and helped him get back on his feet (on dry land) with her advice and nurturing care (tools to stay alive). Women are often referred to as earths, hence “Mother Earth.”"
"Be yourself and know that that’s good enough
 Don’t try to be someone else
 Don’t try to be like someone else, don’t try to act like someone else
 Be yourself, be secure with yourself","The message is rich and simplistic in its nature. It seems obvious to say something like this, to say that you shouldn’t have to conform to anyone else’s standards but, like Frank, it is easier to say than to do. This is directly related to the letter he wrote to the world in 2012 about his infatuation with the same sex.



Individuality is something that we preach to ourselves constantly but sometimes struggle to stay afloat. It’s easy to pick up the blunt, or take a swig from the beer or take a drag from the cigarette. It’s easy to hide the fact that you were in love with someone you weren’t meant to fall in love with. Rosie is telling him (and through Frank, us too) that the only way to security in life is to simply, be yourself."
"Rely and trust upon your own decisions
 On your own beliefs
 You understand the things that I’ve taught you
 Not to drink alcohol, not to use drugs","Despite insisting that Frank “be himself” and “trust” his own decisions, she ironically wants him to act in a way that is consistent with society.  Here we see a generational paradox as on one hand the older generation is attempting to tell the younger to “be themselves” and yet is ordering them to conform."
[Skit: Rosie Watson],"This is Rosie Watson, the mother of one of Frank’s childhood friends. She’s known to leave voicemail messages that give advice or inspiration.

The voicemail is similar to “Not Just Money” on Frank’s debut album channel ORANGE, which Rosie also performed."
Do not get in the car with someone who is inebriated,"Rosie warns Frank not to get into a car with a drunk person at the wheel. In 2014, on average, 28 people died every day because of drunk drivers."
"Don’t use that cocaine or marijuana, because that stuff is highly addictive
 When people become weed-heads
 They become sluggish, lazy, stupid, and unconcerned
 Sluggish, lazy, stupid, and unconcerned
 That’s all marijuana does to you, okay? This is mom",These are old and well-known stereotypes of a marijuana user. Rosie tries to warn him while exaggerating the negative effects of weed. But she cares about him and wants what’s best for him.
"Many college students have gone to college and gotten hooked on drugs, marijuana, and alcohol
 Listen, stop trying to be somebody else
 Don’t try to be someone else","A study done by the Canadian Lung Association showed that a majority of teenagers who had began drinking or smoking did it because of the inclination to “blend in” with his or her surroundings. The same study found that 70% of teenagers who smoke and drink do it out of peer pressure, which is when a person’s friends influence that person’s behavior positively or in this case, negatively.

Rosie tells us it’s okay to be ourselves, no matter what happens. Trying alcohol and marijuana can be toxic for your health, and that if your friends do this and want you to do it with them, they aren’t really your friends."
"Watch my Jagger
 Might lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time","Frank is going so wild dancing that he is tempted to start singing.

The “one time” at the end is also a nice transition into the next few lines. “One time” is slang for police. The party Frank is at is so raucous that the authorities are now arriving to break it up."
"By myself, gone off tabs of that acid","This second line serves as irony and contradicts everything referred to in the previous track.

This line and the overall theme of the track presents Frank’s opinion and stance on the phone call that his friend received on “Be Yourself”."
"We too loud in public, them police turned down the function
 Now we outside and the timing’s perfect
 Forgot to tell you
 Gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
 And we don’t gotta be solo","In this set of lyrics, Frank paints us a vivid picture of him confessing his feelings for a person during a perfect window of calm after the police shut down a party he was at. At this point he seems to be yearning for a relationship rather than glorifying the single life as he seems to during other parts of the song.

This is one of the many times Frank masterfully uses the Solo/So Low double entendre: “we don’t gotta be solo” as in alone and without each other; as well as, “we don’t gotta be so low” as in, open with our feelings/sexuality without hiding it any longer."
"Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish a nigga would cross
 And catch a solo, on time","Frank is feeling unbreakable, down to his bones. Aching to use his power (but not wanting to start shit), he wishes someone would cross him so he could knock them out in one “solo” punch."
"I’m skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long","Because Frank is running on his own without a partner, he is able to forgo typical social expectations for cleanliness. Typically, Frank would care more about avoiding doing these things, but by being solo he has no one to impress.

The line could also be interpreted as an allusion to feeling depressed, a typical effect of a break up. Ocean cares less about his hygiene, to the extent, he even repeats outfits for the most part, if he even goes out at all. By sleeping hard and long, this implies Ocean hasn’t been doing much else."
"White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
 And that mean cheap, ’cause ain’t shit free and I know it
 Even love ain’t, ’cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul
 But you gotta hit the pussy raw, though","Frank juxtaposes the cost of the affordable “green leaf,” or marijuana, to going to an abortion clinic after going in “raw,” or having sex without a condom. As Frank says, the cost of abortion is high, both in terms of your pocketbook and your soul."
There’s a bull and a matador dueling in the sky,"Only one (the bull or the matador) can survive and the loser falls from heaven. Animals are generally considered to lack moral sense, so this is not a mere instance of Manichean good and evil: there is no “correct” decision, no morally acceptable side to align himself with. Still, smoking weed elevates Frank to heaven, but he’ll eventually come down from his high. As such, he  is in limbo, teetering in his appraisal of the situation, unsure if he should take his Mom’s advice or inhale for a temporary ride to heaven, or at least a temporary absence from his down feelings and loneliness."
"Solo (Solo), solo (Solo)
 S-solo (Solo), s-solo (Solo)","The common themes in “Solo” as well as “Solo (Reprise)” are feeling alone when facing life’s problems and inevitably falling to low points in one’s life.

The word “solo” represents both of these themes in a clever double entendre, referring to “going solo” as struggling to face these troubles by himself, or  “going solo/so low” at this point in his life by resorting to drugs and ignoring his mother’s advice to keep his problems at bay.

Also, the arrangement for this song is just Frank and an organ, as if he was playing a solo or just reminds you of the “solo” organ."
"Now stay away from highways
 My eyes like them red lights
 Right now, I prefer yellow
 Redbone, so mellow
 Fuck ’round, be cutting you
 Think we were better off solo","“Yellow” and"" redbone"" are slang for a light-skinned black person and “cutting” means sex.

While “highways” and “red lights” refer to drug use—something Frank’s aunt warns against on “Be Yourself,” they may also refer to the fast-paced lifestyle that often accompanies fame. Red eyes are a common side effect of smoking marijuana and/or lack of sleep.

Yellow lights tend to indicate slowing down or using caution on the road. Similarly, Frank uses the yellow light metaphor to express that right now, he just wants to take things slow.

The use of yellow is also likely a reference to his sexuality. Knowing that the blond/blonde theme, is a metaphor for Frank’s bisexuality, he is technically in-between being gay and straight, similar to how a yellow light is in-between red and green.

Connecting this phrase to the previous, Frank gives us a sort of narrative. After confessing his feelings outside the party, Frank and this person begin a relationship. Frank can’t handle being in a relationship because of his drug use and lust, so he ends up fucking around (cheating) on them. Ultimately, in a sad echo of his proclamation at the end of the previous phrase, Frank breaks things off, saying they were better off solo."
"It’s hell on Earth and the city’s on fire
 Inhale, in hell, there’s heaven","Frank is commenting on the current tumultuous and chaotic state of the world. When he smokes, he reaches “heaven,” a happier place that is free of everyday problems.

“Inhale” is a play on “in hell,” which is ironic considering the weed’s feelings of “heaven.” Frank also juxtaposes getting high to opiate his feeling of “so low.”

Furthermore, this continues the theme of choosing between the traditional definitions of heaven and hell. Typically, smoking marijuana would be associated with Hell, but to Frank it is heaven. Within the traditional concept of “Hell” lies Frank’s “Heaven.” Another example in Frank’s music of duality would be his frequently addressing his own bisexuality.

Frank could also be discussing the inherent duality of life. That things are seldom so cut and dry that anything is purely evil or purely good. Even in the worst situations there is good, even “in hell there’s heaven”."
Because I’m stronger and the Congo is dim,The Congo dimming and slowly beginning to die away may represent Frank as he has begun to detach himself from his need for a partner and found satisfaction in his independence.
"Got your metal on (Ooh), we’re alone
 Making sweet love, takin’ time
 ’Til God strikes us","Since metal is a material that is “typically hard,” Frank makes a play on the phrase, “Get your hard on.”  This phrase is slang for obtaining an erection.

Frank paints an intimate love scene, but he contrasts the aura with the reminder that The Bible depicts God as being anti-homosexuality.  Leviticus 20:13 reads:

If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads."
"Wanna get soaked?
 Wanna film a tape on a speed boat?
 We smell of Californication (Strike a pose)","Frank wants to film a sex tape. Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee’s sextape was stolen from their home in 1995. The tape was filmed on a boat during their honeymoon.



“Californication” is a song by the Red Hot Chili Peppers and a portmanteau on “California” and “fornication.” Given the lyrics throughout this song, it’s likely Frank had sex on a beach in California."
"Everything grows in the Congo
 Everything grows (Ooh)
 Can you come when I call again?","The Democratic Republic of Congo is one of Africa’s biggest producers of cannabis. As a result, significant trafficking occurs to neighbouring countries, including Rwanda, Uganda, Congo and Angola.. The Congo is also home to natural resources needed for cell phones, laptops, and much more.

The Congo may symbolize Frank’s heart and vulnerability– when he meets someone new he begins to become attached quickly and can’t separate his rationality from his emotions, holding him back from growing individually."
"In comes the morning, haunting us with the beams
 Solstice ain’t as far as it used to be","Frank uses the transition from night to day as a way of closing the intimate and beautiful moment he shared with his lover during the night. “Haunting us with the beams” refers to the sun’s rays the next morning—Frank finds it frightening his wonderful night has ended.

The summer solstice occurs each June when the sun is at the highest point in the sky, and thus the furthest from wherever Frank is standing on Earth. The line calls attention to the memories of summers past, when the sun was further away, and the diminishing return of each summer as Frank ages."
"It begins to blur, we get older (Blur, hey)
 Summer’s not as long as it used to be
 Everyday counts like crazy (Smoke, haze, wait)","Expressing a very common sentiment amongst people as they age, namely that time seems to go by faster the older you get.

As a kid everyone can probably remember their summer vacations from school seeming to be almost endless, but as you grow the summer, and often entire years, seem to fly by in the blink of an eye.

There is a lot of thought and study that has gone into this phenomenon. One idea is that, when you’re younger, you experience more “first’s” in your life, and this higher concentration of new experiences makes this time more memorable and seem more significant in hindsight.

Another is the simple fact that, as you get older, each passing year represents a smaller proportion of your cumulative time on earth so far and, as such, feels shorter and less significant.

Regardless of the reasons though, the message is clear. Life is short and time flies, so enjoy every day. Carpe Diem!"
"This is joy, this is summer
 Keep alive, stay alive","While summer typically evokes connotations of happy times, the warmest season has a history of being America’s most deadly due to gun violence.

Frank spent most of his pre-fame years in New Orleans, Louisiana before moving to Los Angeles, California."
"Pretty fuckin’, underneath moonlight now
 Pretty fuckin’, sunrise in sight","“Pretty fucking” is repeated, and can be understood in two different ways. First as an adverbial phrase—Frank may have chosen the line to better describe the “pretty fucking moonlight,” and then as a standalone phrase—having sex under the moonlight."
"The deer run across, kill the headlights","Deer often run across highways, freezing in place when they see car headlights and thus causing vehicular accidents. Turning off the headlights would help prevent this potentially lethal collision.



Frank’s word choice is ironic – “killing” the headlights will prevent the driver and/or deer from being killed in a crash."
"That’s a pretty fuckin’ fast year flew by
 That’s a pretty long third gear in this car
 Glidin’ on the 5","Frank juxtaposes a “fast year” with a “long third gear""—he’s been with this person for a year and although the year went by quickly, the days seem to last forever.

Cars with a manual transmission allow you to stay in a gear for a long period of time (usually third gear) before you have to shift to the next gear. When this happens it feels like you’re just gliding on the road.



“The five” is the Interstate 5, a major highway running north-south through Los Angeles and the rest of California."
"Sometimes you’ll miss it
 And the sound will make you cry
 And some nights, you’re dancing
 With tears in your eyes","Frank performed this alternate version of the bridge at FYF Fest 2017 in Exposition Park, Los Angeles. It’s been one of the few times he’s performed live since his critically-acclaimed album Blonde had been released.

The lyrics are extremely similar to the beginning of Verse 2.

https://youtu.be/RBO7Ud4DeV8?t=142

You can also subtly hear this in the background of the studio version of the song, in a muffled voice."
"Poolside convo about your summer last night, ooh yeah
 About your summer last night
 Ain’t give you no play, mmm
 Could I make you shive last night?
 Could I make you shy on the last night, last night?","Here, Frank details the swiftness with which the two parties in the song developed a relationship. This is perhaps not the ideal setting for facilitating a truly successful relationship, and as the next verse suggests, drugs may have been involved.  (Drug use might be another reason for high-pitch vocals.)

The short intro sets the tone for the rest of the song, as it turns out that their relationship was not made to last, and the two realize they were not made for each other.

Frank sounds like he’s talking to a friend of a friend who’s just in town for a couple of days, asking them “So, how’s your summer?” while wondering if something will happen between them before they both leave.

“Shive” is New Orleans street slang. It means “cool”, “tight”, or “fly”. In this context, possible meanings could mean to give someone a good time, “We could’ve had a good time last night.”"
[Intro: Frank Ocean],This intro features a high-pitch vocal effect Frank uses throughout the album. The squeaky voice suggests Frank is reminiscing about events that happened in his youth. He might be looking back on spending time poolside with his love.
"Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white","This line continues on the theme of Frank  being more experienced than his lover. The phrase “noses on the rail” refers to a rail of cocaine, another name for a line. So Frank referring to his lover as a virgin may not just reference sexual virginity, but also a lack of past drug use, further highlighting the differences between them in their life experiences

Frank makes a double entendre as virgins are associated with the color white because white is known as a symbol of purity and innocence."
Could we make it in? Do we have time?,"The recording speeds up with these lines, suggesting that the answer is a foregone conclusion and that the relationship does not have time. Frank is ultimately sexually attracted to this person and wants to know if they have time to have sex.

The idea that they have a limited amount of time—for sex or other activities—possibly implies that Frank knows that their relationship is coming to an imminent end."
"Now and then, you miss it, sounds make you cry
 Some nights, you dance with tears in your eyes","Music, especially Frank Ocean’s, can definitely elicit the level of emotion that brings someone to tears (see: Pink Matter).

In this case, the music is making Frank’s lover nostalgic for their time together.

Apparently, boys do cry (though the magazine released alongside Blonde suggests otherwise)."
"Wish I was there, wish we’d grown up on the same advice
 And our time was right","This refers to common reasons for the dissolution of relationships: bad timing, lack of effort, and opposing worldviews.

Continuing to contrast maturity levels, Frank expresses disappointment that they did not grow up with similar ideologies. Their relationship did not work out because of their different backgrounds and how it shaped them."
"You cut your hair, but you used to live a blonded life","“Blonded” here sounds strikingly similar to “blinded.” Perhaps tying this song to the title of the album, and the title to larger themes of carelessness and innocence that has been lost. Both blonde hair and overly long hairstyles have stereotypes surrounding them (blondes are thoughtless, long haired people are careless and/or hippies). Cutting that hair could symbolize growing out of that phase, or distancing themselves from that time.

This may be a reference to the story of Samson in the bible, who, after his hair was cut, lost his strength and was blinded after the Philistines gouged out his eyes.

This may also refer to Frank’s ex, Willy Cartier. Cartier is a French model with signature long hair.



The two dated for a bit in 2012 but the relationship didn’t last—his song feels like an ode to the two of them & their brief past together



It’s unclear whether Cartier actually cut his hair short."
"I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
 Take down some summertime
 Give up, just tonight, ’night, ’night
 I, I, I know you got someone comin’
 You’re spittin’ game, know you got it
 I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
 Take down some summertime
 Give up, just tonight, ’night, ’night
 I, I, I know you got someone comin’
 You’re spittin’ game, know you got it (Yeah)
 I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
 Take down some summertime
 Give up, just tonight, ’night, ’night
 I, I, I know you got someone comin’
 You’re spittin’ game, know you got it","Frank knows this person has options but he still wants to be with them. He can’t control himself around them and wants to be their #1 for at least that night.

Throughout the whole outro Frank repeats the words “I,” “Leave,” “Tonight,” all three times,  explaining to his ex that he understands he cannot stay any longer and will leave tonight. This conveys the same surrendering message that Frank wants to give to his ex throughout the outro and whole song.

A distorted sample can be heard throughout this segment, seemingly saying “Come back, Aaliyah,” most likely a reference to the R&B legend herself. Cause of death being a 2001 plane crash, Frank pays homage to the singer by covering her version of “At Your Best (You Are Love)”, originally written by the Isley Brothers, as a part of his Endless album."
"I came to visage ’cause you see me like a UFO
 That’s like never, ’cause I made you use your self-control
 And you made me lose my self-control, my self-control","Any fan of Frank Ocean’s could tell you that he can be somewhat hard to pin down when you’re trying to make plans with him. This person sees Frank so little that it’s like glimpsing an Unidentified Flying Object—an unreal, once-in-a-lifetime occurrence. “U.F.O.” could also stand for his initials: “Unidentified Frank Ocean”.

Frank implies that the reason for their not seeing each other is that they need to execute self control – they realize they can’t be together in the end, so they know it’s for the better to stop seeing each other. While Frank made his lover execute their self control to refrain from visiting him, Frank lost his own self control and came to visit. This, of course, inspires the title of the song.

In later lines, Frank cryptically gives another reason for his infrequent visits, hinting that his lover already has somebody."
"Said if I was in NY, I should look you up","New York is the site where Frank and this other person meet up. In terms of LGTBQ+ relations, New York is largely known for the Stonewall riots in Greenwich Village within Lower Manhattan; Lower Manhattan later becomes the location where Frank’s Homer brand store is established."
"Here’s to a good guy, he hooked it up",Frank mentions how a “good guy” who is likely a friend of his was able to find someone that might be interested in pursuing a romantic relationship with Frank.
Here’s to the gay bar you took me to,"Frank makes a toast to the place that he and the guy (not the “good guy,” who actually set them up) went to in an effort to recall the experience without dwelling on the painfulness of the situation. Frank evidently had feelings that were not reciprocated:

I know you don’t need me right now
And to you it’s just a late night out

In an April 2019 cover story for Gayletter Magazine, Frank revealed that the gay bar he’s referencing in this line is Boxers, a small chain of LGBT sports bars with locations in NYC’s Hell’s Kitchen and Chelsea neighborhoods."
And you text nothing like you look,"Upon meeting for the first time, Frank is confronted with the dissimilarity between his date’s real-life appearance and the likely idealized version they shared prior to meeting in the flesh.

Continuing on a common theme throughout Endless and Blonde, Ocean uses this moment to highlight the difference between people’s real and virtual selves."
"I, first time I’d ever saw you","This line works to introduce  that Frank was speechless when he first met this person.  The fact that he starts the line one way, by saying “I” but then ends this thought and goes on to another is indicative of speechlessness or stuttering."
"I, here’s to the highlights when I was convinced
 That this was much more to you than some some night shit
 I know you don’t need me right now
 And to you, it’s just a late night out","This is the turning point in the date for Frank as he realizes that this man is different than he expected. It comes off as poignant as Frank seems disillusioned about this person after meeting him, and he realizes the date is likely not the start of a great love affair but just another typical night."
"Bitches, nigga, all the bitches in the neighborhood wanna fuck you, nigga
 They told me
 I used to fuck with all of ’em
 Yeah, I ain’t got bitches no more
 But now I don’t care about bitches like that, my nigga, that shit—
 Jasmine fucking wrecked my heart, I don’t even know how to feel about bi—","In this conversation between two guys, the first guy seems straight and not really interested in the other guy’s opinion—he just wants to hear himself talk and rant about how his heart has been broken.

The second guy, who “all the bitches in the neighborhood wanna fuck,” seems much more reserved, like Frank is. The relatively long pause he takes before saying “Yea I ain’t got bitches no more” indicates he’s picking his words carefully and feels uncomfortable in the situation. He might be gay, but doesn’t quite know how to tell his friend, or whoever it is he’s talking to.

So we’re left with this snippet of a conversation between two guys about how they are over girls, one of whom is over girls because they “fucking wrecked his heart”, the other is over girls because he was never truly into them."
Here’s when I realized you talk so much more than I do,"Frank is known for being a quiet person, and it’s at this lyric that he’s noticing that the difference between his quiet personality and the loud personality of the song’s subject might be the source of conflict

As an introvert even in public/social settings Frank is analyzing the person. He sees early on that the difference between them is too large for it to ever work."
"Can’t keep bein’ laid off
 Know you need the money if you gon’ survive","Frank is talking to himself here. He knows he needs money if he wants to continue his career as an artist.

He is his own boss and responsible for his progress, therefore, he “can’t keep being late” on himself when going to work every night."
"Signal comin’ in and out
 Hope you’re doin’ well, bruh
 Everybody needs you
 Everybody needs you","These couple of lyrics deal with the lack of communication between the two sides. It is made clear through previous lines that the strength of the relationship is consistently wavering, as he sings, “you are from my past life, hope you’re doing well bruh.”

The idea of a signal is similar to that of cell phone service, with the signal being the strength of communication between the two people.

Everybody may need her, however the lack of signal is preventing this. The idea of a séance is almost like they are trying to communicate with someone they have no connection to."
"Everybody needs you
 No, you can’t make everybody equal","Whoever Frank is talking about is busy and feels important, if not important in reality. They feel the anxiety of making everyone happy, giving everyone an equal share of their life. Frank says its impossible: “No you can’t make everybody equal.” Frank may be affirming this person’s character and personality by saying “everybody needs you” but this line evolves over the verse and it later sounds less like the affirmation found here and more like a pejorative coming from Frank as if Frank is a victim of this person’s anxiety and inability to prioritize people in their life."
"Breathe ’til I evaporated
 My whole body see through","Frank might be referencing a smoke session with the person from the previous lines. He hits the bong so much with this person that he starts to evaporate into clouds. In that way, his body becomes transparent like a haze.

“You don’t even got nobody being honest with you…” but Frank is saying, he’s made himself so vulnerable to this person, more so than all this family. As details of the relationship progress, we learn that soon they are only rolling marijuana as a cheap vacation. What was once a vulnerable honest relationship has turned into a cheap, easy escape. We can all relate to those relationships that have digressed from intimate to escape.

“Whole body see through” –
Can be in relation to his response of “nobody being honest with you”. He is transparent compared to these people, he is evaporated.

Also could be in reference to his enthusiasm for cars and how the next line “Transportation, handmade” supports that. The body to his car could be see through meaning you can see the internal specs such as the engine. A handmade car could include this feature."
"Round your city, round the clock","Frank is referring to someone who is seen as a leading figure, someone with power or that the city looks up to. This person or entity is needed to do something for someone at all hours of the day.

Perhaps this could be a possible ode to Frank himself. The social world ridiculed him for taking so long to release this album that maybe he felt pressured every hour of the day. Everywhere he turned someone was expecting him to produce."
"My every day shit, every night shit, every day shit
 (Every night shit, night shit, night shit, night shit)","Another social commentary on the monotony of life, Frank is talking about how the majority of people stick tightly to a schedule of working, sleeping, and doing it all over again until they die, not really happy, but at least they had food.

Alternatively, this could be referring to those who are struggling and need to work nights and days to put food on the table, and almost as if Frank Ocean has been in that situation himself.

This could be mentioning how Frank had been working in the studio every day in the night, working on, forming, scrapping, and shaping his album."
"The sun’s goin’ down
 Time to start your day, bruh","Many people start the day when the sun comes up, but not Ocean, tying into the song’s title—“Nights.” The contrast between day and night creates tension similar to another song on the album, “Nikes,” because the video version of the track creates conflict by featuring two competing voices.

Other tracks on Blonde like “Solo” also have this kind of binary opposition. In this track, Ocean contrasts his emotional lows to his high when he smokes. The clash between Ocean’s sexuality and the hip hop world comes through in these specific back and forth conflict themes in various tracks on the album."
"Every night shit, every day shit","Ocean closes out a tense and anxious verse by stating and restating that the troubles and inconveniences he thinks of: loved ones, life after death, shitty conversations and getting high are always on his mind, day or night.



The repetition, multi-tracked looped vocals and dragging “a”s and “i”s, further highlight that this truly is a revolving mindset that picks at Frank’s brain regularly.

For a song that instrumentally shifts several times and lyrically meditates on “new beginnings” and “nirvana”, the notion of repetition brings Frank’s more profound thoughts soberingly down to earth."
"New beginnings, ahh
 New beginnings, wake up, akh","‘Akh’ is a shortened term for ‘Akhi.’ The term had originally derived from Arabic, it means brother, however, it is used as a common slang. The word also has a religious connotation in Islam as it’s emanated from the religion’s holy book, the Qurʾān where it’s said that it teaches “the believers are but brothers.”

As Frank resumes to speak about new beginnings, it can possibly relate to the Egyptian meaning where it means that “the spirit of a deceased person conceived as gloriously transfigured so as to reflect the deeds of the person in life.”."
"Ain’t no bitch in my body, ah","This line might be a shoutout to a lyric from Earl Sweatshirt’s “DNA”:

Ain’t no bitch in my DNA

Frank finishes off the verse by iterating the fact that he’s got no fear in his body adding on the sentiment he’s nodding to throughout the verse."
So low that I can give a fuck about what is trending,"Andre, as part of OutKast, never followed trends. His withdrawal from hip-hop, although not total, has seen him release at most 1 or 2 guest verses a year, and his low profile and low output shows a disregard for trends and popularity. It clearly works, judging by the fervour surrounding each verse he releases."
"So low that when they throw pussy or pesos
 Don’t pay no attention to it","Andre’s low mood has robbed him of the ability to enjoy the typical allures of money and women. It’s not a new attitude; during T.I.’s “Sorry” he denounced his love for money, and during “Da Art of Storytellin' (Part 4)” he schooled a young girl about the value of a dollar when being asked to throw his money in the air at a club.

Why?
The world needs sun
The hood needs funds
There’s a war going on and half the battle is guns
How dare I throw it on the floor
When people are poor

On the same track, Andre details the deceptive nature of a woman who attempts to lure him to bed whilst openly conversing with her boyfriend in front of him. Andre looks down on this and shows her the door.

The Outkast reunion tours even made him feel like a sellout."
"Just saying it, we being real persons
 I hate that it’s like this, I feel for you, ant
 I don’t know what it’s like with a skirt on
 So pardon me if I am being insensitive
 But darling, this only worsens","Andre is just being honest. He’s criticizing women with fake body parts who demand “realness” from their men, and at the same time relating to their struggle. The “ant” from the beginning of the verse reappears, this time as the women he encounters. The misogyny in hip-hop culture can make them feel small and inconsequential, and he excuses his lines by pleading ignorance.

This may be a reaction to the criticism Outkast received during their reunion shows, specifically Andre himself who was accused by some of lewd acts on stage. He considers himself a feminist, but he’s also admitted to treating women poorly in the past.

 I’ve been guilty of it, too, in my earlier raps, and I know my mom raised me much better than what I’d been talking. But you do it because you wanna impress people around you, you wanna feel invincible, you wanna feel tough. And that’s a part of rap. You never wanna have any kind of weak links."
"So low my halo stay way low, it feels like it’s bent","Andre is regularly touted as one of the best rappers of all time. He argues his depression bends his “halo,” blocking him from enjoying or even believing what is written about him.

“So-lo” may also refer to his solo career, which is basically nonexistent outside of guest verses. He claims his rap halo is shared with OutKast partner Big Boi, and without him he feels like less of an artist.



It may also refer to the morality he felt he lacked in the previous lines. His inability to relate to women and their struggle makes him feel worse about himself, and his past lyrics."
"Ayy
 Ayy, so now I’m","“So-lo” is a homophone of “so low,” so Andre is both solo on this track (and his career) and “so low” he can peek under the skirt of an ant, whose size is about 1 millimetre.

“Low” is an adjective used to describe depression, something he’s battled before. He no longer feels “high,” to the extent that when he yells “Geronimo!""—an exclamation used when jumping from a great height—he can’t get through the entire word. He’s already so close to the ground he only has time to say ""eh.”"
"With astonishment while I’m on punishment
 Watchin’ the summer come close to an end","3K continues the kid analogy and may be indicating he’s coming out of hiatus.
 He’s amazed at what hip-hop is now while he’s been less active (he mentions ghost-writers in the next line) but now the summer is coming to an end so he’s returning to the game.

It’s possible this self-imposed exile is seen as some form of punishment, related to his materialistic youth alluded to earlier.

There have been reports that Andre is recording his first solo album, though nothing confirmed.

In a more literal sense, Blonde was released on August 20 2016 – close to the end of the summer."
"Tryna cut down on my spending
 Regardless of winning, instead of pretending","3 Stacks is cutting the pony off his Polo, attempting to avoid the consumerism that litters modern hip hop. He said he “felt like a sellout” during the 2014 OutKast reunion tours, despite the glowing reviews the duo received."
"So low that I can admit
 When I hear that another kid is shot by the popo
 It ain’t an event no more","Following the shooting of Trayvon Martin and the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement, the American public and news media have become much more aware of police brutality against minorities in America.

The tragic deaths of Mike Brown, Jonathan Ferrell, John Crawford, Ezell Ford, Laquan McDonald, Akai Gurley, Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, Sandra Bland, Samuel DuBose, Alton Sterling, and Philando Castile have been widely protested, debated and reports of these police killings have dominated the news cycle constantly.

Andre bitterly admits that these tragic killings are so frequent now that when he hears a kid has been shot by an officer it doesn’t shock him anymore, which is a sobering statement in itself.

During the 2014 OutKast reunion shows, Andre wore jumpsuits with a series of slogans centred around racism in America."
"And bending over backwards
 Over half of these hoes had work done
 Sayin’ they want something real from a man","Andre comments on the culture of surgical enhancement that has emerged in American hip-hop culture. These women require a “real” man, who doesn’t lie or cheat, but they lie about whether their appearance is natural or artificial.

This line also anticipates the ghost-writing criticism below: half of the the rap game, like half of current hoes, have “had work done”.

3 Stacks hasn’t been chasing women for a while, dating Dominique Maldanado with rumours that they may even be engaged surfacing."
"I’m hummin’ and whistlin’ to those not deserving
 I’ve stumbled and lived every word, was I working just way too hard?","There are lots of catchy tracks out now that still capture everyone’s attention, despite having little substance and containing the wrong ingredients, even being written by others.

As half of rap duo Outkast, and blurring the lines between funk, hip hop and R&B on The Love Below, there’s little debate he was incredibly popular and successful. But artists like Drake are slaying Billboard records while allegedly using ghostwriters. Andre is sarcastically wondering if he was just wasting his time writing his deep original lyrics when he could have had someone else write them.

“Humming and whistling” implies he was enjoying the music without attributing the credit to who was really deserving – the writers of the songs."
Those are my niggas for life,"Here, Frank is most likely referring to the Los Angeles Hip-hop collective Odd Future in which he was once apart of. The group consisted of close friends such as Syd , Earl Sweatshirt and Tyler, the Creator who Frank later mentions in the last song Futura Free. The group shared a lot of memories and moments with each other in their early youth and here franks makes the point that they would always be his friends for life."
"Now, to the edge, I’ll race
 To the end, I’ll make it","Frank is stating that he will “make it” to the end and “race” to the edge, showing his determination to not give up in his feat, whatever that feat may be.

Judging by the context of the rest of Blonde—and “Pretty Sweet,” specifically—it seems as though he is saying that he won’t let the fear of death or those who want to hold him back stop him from finding success."
"Head bang with my faux friends
 We pour a taste out for the dead","To “headbang” is to shake one’s head up and down with great force to the beat of music, usually rock or heavy metal.

“Faux” means fake. Frank’s friends are not true to him and will readily betray him.

Nowadays, it’s common for young adults to start hanging out with the wrong crowd; people that claim to be “friends” but have ulterior motives. Often, troubled youth will get themselves involved with drugs or heavy alcohol consumption. Frank and his friends are partying or “headbanging” and “pouring out another taste” of liqour. They are oblivious to the consequences of alcohol abuse—death potentially being one of them.

Additionally, Frank may be referring to libation, the practice of spilling alcohol onto the ground to commemorate the life of a deceased friend.

With these conditions—a gathering of friends with some out for betrayal and a ceremonial taste of wine—it could be seen as a contemporary version of the Last Supper; Frank likening his friends to that of a Judas Iscariot, who infamously sold out Jesus for silver pieces."
"Mothers of us, be kind
 To the fathers on whom we rely
 Fathers of us, be kind
 To the mothers on whom we rely
 Ah-hah, ah-hah
 Ah-hah, ah-hah
 Ah-hah, ah-hah
 Ah-hah, ah-hah
 Ah-hah","This adds onto the themes of duality between males and females through Blonde. The juxtaposition of “mothers and fathers” reflect how parents should be kind to each other which in turn will reflect in how their children treat other people too.

This metaphorical imagery of a family may connect to a line found in “Voodoo”:

Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun"
"What it means to be alive on this side
 (Said you wanna kill me now)
 On this side
 (Don’t let me down)
 On this side
 (Down, down)
 Fuck the other side
 I’m on this side
 I’m on this side
 I’m on this side","This line is a complex double entendre. On this side has two meanings.  The first meaning is he is out of the closet, since he announced that he is bisexual, he is literally saying fuck the other side, fuck being in the closet. The other meaning is that he is on this side of the line that divides life and death, and he is saying fuck the other side, I’m alive right now and I’m not concerned with death.

This could be a response to Christians that tell gay people they will go to Hell when they die.

“This Side” also is a reference to the bifurcated nature of Blonde. This is the first song (besides the interlude “Solo (Reprise)”) after Nights, a song that is famous for its beat switch that perfectly divides the album at the halfway point. This being the first fully developed song after Nights, Frank takes the opportunity to point out that we’re on a different “side” of the album. The second half of Blonde is very bleak and atmospheric, which starts to be reflected in this track and is further developed as the album progresses."
"We know you’re sugar
 We know you’re sweet like a sucker
 Pretty sweet
 Pretty sweet","In the south, where Frank was raised, (New Orleans, to be exact) calling someone sweet, or saying they have sugar in their step is an indirect way of calling them gay.

The line “sweet like a sucka” is a double-entendre, and could mean sweet like a lollipop, which some refer to as a sucker, or sucker as in someone who falls for tricks. The line could be interpreted as complimentary, or condescending, depending on the interpretation."
"This is the blood, the body, the life right now","A reference to the Christian rite of Communion, where bread and wine are blessed and distributed to the congregation during Mass. The tradition usually involves a eucharistic liturgy reenacting the Last Supper, when Jesus ate with his disciples the night before being arrested and put to death.

In Catholicism, it is believed that during this ritual, the bread and wine actually transfigure into the body and blood of Jesus.

Throughout the song, Frank conflates the religious dogma of Christianity with the secular comfort of communing with friends and family."
"I said, ”Come on, you’re crazy, because like, yeah
 I’m in front of you, I’m every day, here in your house”",SebastiAn doesn’t understand the need to accept this girl on Facebook when they’ve been dating for 3 years. He is under the impression that their relationship is serious enough and clear to the real world that it doesn’t need to be virtually represented.
"No, I was just telling that I, I got this, this girl before
 And I was together since three years
 And uh, I was not even cheating her or what","He had been dating this woman for 3 whole years and had been faithful to her the entire time.
“Or what” makes it seems like he is trying to express how senseless this girl’s reaction was. She didn’t really had a good reason to react the way she did since he didn’t do anything bad."
"She starting to be crazy
 She thought that because I didn’t accept her, she thought I was cheating
 She told me like, uh, “It’s, it’s over, I can’t believe you”","Social media is a major part of many people’s lives, but many people would rather see someone face to face than use technology to communicate in order for their lives not to be taken over by it, as stated in the previous annotation.

Becoming suspicious of the man not adding her in Facebook, she begins to act crazy. This girl believes he is hiding something from her on his account, and she eventually comes to the conclusion that he won’t add her because he is cheating on her. Even though this man isn’t cheating on her and won’t add her because he doesn’t want their lives and relationship to be reliant on Facebook, the girl decides to call it quits with him anyway."
"And Facebook arrived and, uh
 She wanted me to accept her on Facebook
 And I don’t want it, because I was, like, in front of her
 In front of her, and she told me, like, “Accept me on Facebook”
 It was virtual, means no sense
 So I say, “I’m in front of you, I don’t need to accept you on Facebook”","As time goes on, technology has progressively become a more prominent part of our daily lives. Though it is meant to accommodate us, technology has actually become counter-intuitive in the sense that it’s starting to take away from us living in the real world, whether it’s through electronic devices, social media, video games, etc.

In this example, SebastiAn’s girl insists that he add her on Facebook, even though they are literally right in front of each other and can interact in person. This speaks to the fact that people have become obsessed with living out their lives through technology and less inclined to be present in real life.

A similar sentiment is depicted on Frank’s track “Device Control” from his visual album, Endless."
Let my mind run underneath warm jets,"“warm jets” are most likely referring to a shower, where Frank goes to clear his head. The shower is seen to many as a place of peace and comfort where individuals go to relax and let their thoughts wander.

This line could be a referencing Blonde’s album cover which depicts a wet, Frank, with his hand over his face in a contemplative fashion.



This line directly reflects the song’s introspective nature in which Frank speaks on a past relationship, the time that has passed between his past lover, and the amount of time they may or may not have left together. Similar ideas and themes is brought up again in the following track, “White Ferrari”, as well.

Interestingly, Frank has referenced showers before on his previous album in a much more sexualized manner."
"Why am I preaching
 To this choir, to this atheist?",His lover is not going to hear him or take him back. His words are in vain like preaching to the choir. Frank takes this metaphor further as he preaches to someone who doesn’t even believe in what he has to say.
"Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
 After a while, they’re keeping me close to you","Frank is holding onto memories of his lover, who is the only other person with the same memories of them together.

Frank comes to the sobering realization that even though the relationship is at its end, the memories of their love continues to keep them close."
"[Outro: Stevie Wonder]
 Just like me, they long to be close to you","These lines come from the first verse of Stevie Wonder’s “Talkbox Medley (Close To You / Never Can Say)”:

Why do birds suddenly appear?
Every time that you are near, baby?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

Circling birds around a person’s head is the cartoon representation of “seeing stars” or being stunned (usually because of head trauma).



Although Frank wasn’t devastated from his break-up, he could have been stunned that it happened. Frank is also expressing that he wishes to still be with this person despite the fact that they left him so coldly.

This song is a cover by Frank of Stevie’s cover of the song “(They Long To Be) Close To You” by the Carpenters.

[Verse: Frank Ocean],"In an interview with Zane Lowe for Beats 1 radio, Chance The Rapper stated that Frank Ocean had Francis and the Lights show him the Prismizer technology Francis developed to use on Blonde. This song includes vocals that have been modified using the Prismizer.

https://twitter.com/chancetherapper/status/767705117571313664

The decision to do so was most likely to pay homage to the medley Stevie Wonder did on The David Frost Show using a Vocoder



Wonder using a Vocoder"
"I’ll be honest, I wasn’t devastated
 But you could’ve held my hand through this, baby","Even though he and his lover had broken up, Frank wasn’t crushed. Sad? Yes, but not devastated. Despite this, he felt lonely and his lover didn’t bother to hold his hand or tell him it’ll be okay. They just simply ended their relationship out of the blue, and Frank is left gripping what’s left of his memories of their relationship."
"In this life (Life), in this life (Life)","Frank waxes poetic on this bridge, exercising the common idiom mind over matter, which refers to discarding of materialistic things in favor of a freer state of mind. He champions this ideology, claiming it works almost as effectively as magic. He himself lives in this train of thought – as a result, he’s able to perform with such a high level of success.

He comes to a fleeting end in the bridge with an existential thought: he suggests that life, no matter how incredible, passes by in the blink of the eye. As a conclusive statement, it’s extremely powerful: Ocean’s telling the listener that they should let go of materialism because life happens too quickly for us to hold onto physical forms of wealth and success.



The line stands in opposition to “Pink Matter,” where Frank champions “pleasure over matter”. His reprioritization of “mind of matter” now shows us how he considers a metaphysical connection far more potent than a physical one."
"Can’t take what’s been given (No way)
 But we’re so okay here, we’re doing fine
 Primal and naked","Frank finds the best way of keeping the relationship alive is taking things back to basics. Primal refers to the fundamental actions of humans, which have always been necessary, in this case, sex. And even when other parts of the relationship fall apart, the primal always remains, which gives Frank hope that they’re ‘doing fine."
"One too many years
 Some tattooed eyelids on a facelift
 (Thought you might want to know now)","Many times, when someone gets a facelift, his or her eyes will appear to be perpetually open, and thus his or her eyelids will never be seen. If you get tattoos on your eyelids after a facelift, it is likely no one will see those tattoos.

This situation is analogous to the ephemeral nature of some memories. Some memories are permanently etched in like tattoos, but are never accessed by the person (also known as retrieval failure) much like the tattoos on eyelids.

It’s also imperative to realize that facelifts are procedures to erase age and time. Similarly, the erosion and malleability of memory are consistent topics on Blond."
"Basic takes its toll on me, ’ventually, ’ventually, yes
 Ahh, on me ’ventually, ’ventually, yes","Someone is “basic” when they follow all the trends without showing a style of their own. Frank has been described as a refusenik before, and has set his own artistic direction, opting not to follow pre-established trends.

In addition, one of the reasons he ended the described relationship is because he wanted to move on or do more with his life, while his partner wasn’t moving as fast."
"White Ferrari, had a good time
 (Sweet sixteen, how was I supposed to know anything?)","The White Ferrari symbolizes the purity and innocence of the relationship. His thoughts on the relationship at the moment end with it merely being a “good time.”

The sincerity of their love is represented by the Ferrari—something that is both rare, desirable,  extremely valuable, and precious."
I let you out at Central,"Central may refer to Central City, a neighborhood in Ocean’s hometown of New Orleans. The neighborhood is a historic center of African American culture."
"I didn’t care to state the plain
 Kept my mouth closed
 We’re both so familiar","Frank didn’t bother to tell the person he is dropping off that he loves them; it is “plain” to see and obvious, so he lets them leave in silence.

“We’re both so familiar” could reference how comfortable they are with each other and how familiar they are with this routine."
"You dream of walls that hold us in prison
 It’s just a skull, least that’s what they call it
 And we’re free to roam","There’s a lot of different ideas about what exactly Frank’s alluding to when he mentions “prison.” On one hand, it might be addressing the insecurity of his partner: his significant other suffers from a great deal of doubt. Their relationship’s unable to move to another level while his partner continues to think without complete faith, thus entrapping Frank.

At the same time, Ocean is also turning prison into a physical representation for our skulls. Heads physically contain the mind, where thoughts roam, and thus ideas are physiologically imprisoned by the skull.

In the following line, Frank mentions that freedom of movement, as if the prison of the skull does not exist. This concept is exactly what he is trying to convey to his lover; skulls are just bones, and in reality our thoughts are free to roam regardless of the physical boundaries. They ought to let go and start thinking openly."
"You’re tired of movin’, your body’s achin’
 We could vacay, there’s places to go
 Clearly, this isn’t all that there is","The disagreements between Frank and the song’s subject mentioned in the lines above these continue, this time regarding the idea of going out and seeing the world. Frank wants to escape and explore, while the other person is not so enthused about the idea.

This line is also interesting because it totally contradicts the sentiment that Frank expressed (albeit mockingly) in “Sweet Life” on Channel Orange"
"I care for you still and I will forever
 That was my part of the deal, honest
 We got so familiar","Similar to a car, Frank assures this person that he has and will continue to love and care for them, upholding  his part of the deal. From the iconic Acura Integra that was focused on in “Acura Integurl” to his Tumblr post confessing his love for this BMW E30, Frank has shown his own love for cars. It appears he’s doing this here as well, using the White Ferrari as a metaphor for the love and experienced shared with an unnamed individual.

Upon the release of Blond, Frank once again took to Tumblr to express his feelings. He asks “How much of my life has happened in a car,” among other things. He then describes his life and it’s changes with various cars being present. These cars include a  GT3 RS, “Sinewy Crossover SUV,” and a Mclaren F1 worth $16 million dollars. The title “Blonde” itself is derived from a picture of a blonde-haired girl strapped into the seat of a car.

As far as people go, Frank assured his first love that while they weren’t together, he still loved him."
"High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice","This line suggests that Frank’s existential thoughts on his mortality in the previous lines are as a result of him smoking weed – high flights and inhale the vapor.

“High flights” is a double entendre, as it refers to both Frank’s drug high and the ‘hang gliding’ he does in the lines following. Inhale the vapor alludes to the previous lines' connotations of flames and burning.

When Frank “thinks twice,” this could be referring to his mortality or to the lover he cries over in the next line. Thinking twice displays vulnerableness and insecurity, a theme that is prevalent in the track."
"This, this fe—, this feel, this feel, this feels
 This feels how molly must feel
 This feels how molly must feel
 How molly must feel
 This feels how molly must feel
 How molly must feel","“Molly” is a slang term for MDMA, a drug that is constantly taken at parties and is also referred by other street terms such as ecstasy and X. Some of its side effects include euphoria, relaxation, increased social confidence, and experiencing the feeling of inner peace.

Fitting in with the calm, psychedelic vibe of “Seigfried” and how Frank feels as if he’s experiencing nirvana, he claims (in a sped-up voice which hints at euphoria) that he’s encountering effects similar to MDMA. He also subliminally mentions experiencing depression in the preceding line and throughout most of Blonde which is why Frank is consuming molly.

Frank partially used this line in the opening track for his 2013 European tour, “Feel California”:

This is how molly must feel
How molly must feel word
Molly must feel, word
Know what I mean"
"Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
 There with my crooked teeth and companion sleeping, yeah
 Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
 That could think of the dreamer that thought
 That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God
 I be dreaming of dreaming a thought
 That could dream about a thought
 That could think of dreaming a dream
 Where I cannot, where I cannot","The phoenix is a rare and mythical beast that would sooner burn completely to ash than leave a feather in its' place. This spirit of nirvana, or joy, is as rare as that very creature to Frank. He dreams within a dream, feels within a seam of thinking between the lines as  Sartre and Philip K. Dick might; trying to find a thought within a thought: between drugs and misunderstandings.

He’s getting lost in his thoughts hoping he could see God. He thinks of a dreamer who could think of dreaming and gets a glimmer of God. Frank thinks of a hopeful guy, who in his hopefulness and faith gets a glimmer of God. But then when Frank tries to get the glimmer of God, within his own thoughts and efforts, he cannot. The glimmer of God, like nirvana, is as rare as the feathers from a phoenix.

Less spiritually speaking and more philosophically: this also fits in with the theory of reflexivity: “the movement whereby that which has been used to generate a system is made, through a changed perspective, to become part of the system it generates” (Hayles, How we Became Posthuman, page 43). Similarly, Jorge Luis Borges' story, “The Circular Ruins,” in which Borges “imagines a narrator who creates a student through his dreaming only to discover that he himself is being dreamed by another” (43) details a similar line of philosophical thinking that is trapped in reflexivity, which appears critical to Frank’s lyrics here."
"Eat some shrooms, maybe have a good cry about you
 See some colors, light hang glide off the moon","Shrooms is a nickname for psilocybin mushrooms, one of the more common psychedelic drugs. They’re known to send people on mind-bending trips and invoke strong emotion, hence Frank taking some to escape the sadness about his failed relationship, or maybe have a therapeutic cry about it."
"Less morose and more present
 Dwell on my gifts for a second, a moment","As Frank so often does, he uses a play on words to emphasize his shift in mindsets. The “present” is a gift on its own, and worth getting out of his own head to appreciate. Frank is ditching his sullen attitude and thoughts, trading them in for a more positively-focused mindset.

However, this resolution is immediately undermined by the next set of lines which take a turn for the morbid, musing on how fragile our existence is and the likelihood that our lives could end at any moment."
"I’m not brave
 I’d rather live outside
 I’d rather live outside
 I’d rather go to jail",Frank would rather live on the streets or in jail than to surrender his life and lifestyle to the typical American suburban dream.
"Maybe I’m a fool
 Maybe I should move and settle
 Two kids and a swimming pool","Frank speaks about his interest in pursuing the American Dream and “settling down” to start a family with two children and a swimming pool. In the lines before, he claims he’d prefer to leave the limelight of fame and the chaos of the artist’s life. His ideas of conforming to societal expectations and starting a family are reminiscent of 1950s America after World War 2, which saw millions of Americans move out to the suburbs and inspired a baby boom. These lines call back to  earlier lines from “Solo,” where Frank discusses a suburban couple’s struggle with divorce:

Now your baby momma ain’t so vicious
All she want is her picket fence
And you protest and you picket sign
But them courts won’t side with you

Frank could also be speaking about his struggles being a queer man who feels pressure from society to settle down with a woman, ignoring that he has interests in men as well. By “living outside,” Frank suggests he will escape those social pressures and live his life as he chooses."
"I’m living over city
 And taking in the homeless sometimes, I’ve","Frank has already said he’d rather live outside. When he’s in the city he sees the homeless and doesn’t think their life is too bad.

Alternatively, he is taking “the homeless,” meaning flings, family and friends, strangers—people who do not feel like they have a home to go back to, either literally or figuratively—into his house in the city. He doesn’t mind giving up his space to help others. This returns to the rejection of physical goods."
"(In the dark)
 (In the dark)
 I’d do anything for you
 (In the dark)
 I’d do anything for you
 (In the dark)
 I’d do anything for you
 (In the dark)
 I’d do anything for you
 (In the dark)
 I’d do anything for you, anything for you
 (In the dark)
 I’d do anything for you, anything for","Frank is so invested in this person that he would do anything for them, even where no one can see, just to show that it doesn’t matter if anyone sees his efforts, he just wants to do the best he can for this person.
He is desperate and will do anything to please his lover in the dark. He knows he can’t be with this person all the time (the light) but he can be with them in the dark where no one knows.
Perhaps a loose metaphor for being in the closet. He’s in love with a closeted man, so anything he does for him has to be out of the public eye."
"I’ve tried hell
 (It’s a loop) What would you recommend I do?
 (The other side of the loop is a loop)","On Blonde’s fifth track, “Solo,” Frank uses the metaphorical depths of hell (plus some wordplay with “solo/so low” and “inhale/in hell”) to symbolize the depths of depression.

He continues the directional metaphors with this “loop”, which harkens back to the cyclical nature of life touched on in “Nights”:

Every night fucks every day up
Every day patches the night up

Depression can tend to be cyclical (or “recurrent”) as well. It is expressed here as a recurrent “hell” that Frank has experienced and ostensibly can’t escape, given the fact that a loop is, by definition, self-enclosed.

The “other side of a loop is a loop” evokes the infinity symbol."
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes,"The love Frank has experienced will last forever, despite any drastic changes throughout his life. Additionally, the idea of love sticking with the two through blindness suggests that Frank’s feelings are rooted in a deep connection, rather than just a physical one.

Frank may also be saying that their love has made the two better with relationships with future partners as they have learned from their mistakes and won’t dive straight into relationships as hastily."
"Let go of a prayer for you
 Just a sweet word
 The table is prepared for you","Regardless of the fact Frank has lost his “claim” on this person, he still wishes them all the best, going as far as praying for them. Past even that, he assures them that there is always a table to which they can return and break bread.

Finally, adding to the religious allusions throughout the song, Frank references Psalms 23:

You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies

This suggests that Frank will always offer shelter and security to them amidst the turmoil of the world."
"You’ll look down on where you came from sometimes
 But you’ll have this place to call home always","This is a quintessential American narrative in as much as we’re encouraged to leave home and look for ‘better’ things, which ultimately displaces the unique singularity that is ‘home.’  Frank assures his younger self, and others, that although they may grow and change, beginning to resent this place, they’ll always be able to claim that place as home.

“Look down on where you came from” may be a reference to either looking down on the relationship or to the place the couple grew up."
"I let go of my claim on you
 It’s a free world","This line directly contrasts the theme of “Bad Religion,” another religious-themed track. Throughout Blonde and Channel Orange, Frank tries to get back together with someone he’s loved dearly. However, this person never returns his affection, resulting in unrequited love, or Frank’s “claim” on this person.

In “Bad Religion,” Frank professes that he could “never make him love me,” though he tries repeatedly. At the time, Frank was stuck in the “one-man cult” of loving this person. Now he can be free."
"I will always love you
 How I do","In the Boys Don’t Cry magazine which accompanied the album, Frank wrote about how he missed his teenage years:

I don’t think I shed a tear for a good chunk of my teenage years. It’s surprisingly my favorite part of life so far… Maybe that part had its rough stretches too, but in my rearview mirror, it’s getting small enough to convince myself it was all good.

This line could be a reference to those years. He will always love those teenage years as they seem perfect to him now. Those were the days boys didn’t cry."
"Oh, oh
 I’ll always love you
 Until the time we die
 Oh, oh","This holds as a sweet goodbye and release for Frank Ocean. He’s let go of the love he’s had for this person. Usually when people separate, it’s from a place of anger and hatred for this person. But since this person is “a positive motivating force” in his life, there’s no hard feelings.

This is sung by Kim Burrell, who is widely considered to be one of the greatest gospel singers of all time."
"Wishing you godspeed, glory
 There will be mountains you won’t move
 Still, I’ll always be there for you
 How I do","To wish one godspeed is to wish one good luck and safety on their journey.

Unlike a younger Frank in nostalgia, ULTRA. and even Channel ORANGE, Frank has matured to a point where he feels he can give assurance to others who may be going through the same things he has.

The significance of the term godspeed is of particular interest regarding Frank. Having both chosen to believe in God and question religion entirely, it appears that while conflicted, Frank still hopes that God will watch over himself and those he cares about.

The moving mountains portion alludes to Matthew 17:20:

He replied, “Because you have so little faith. Truly I tell you, if you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move. Nothing will be impossible for you.”

This means that sometimes you won’t have enough faith and may fail at times."
"[Sage]
 Probably, uh, probably Tyler, his life seems pretty awesome
 No, actually, no, fuck him uh
 I don’t know
 Probably Dill, ’cause he doesn’t have to do anything at all
 Just sits inside his house","The question asked to them was: if you could be anyone else who would you be?
Sage says Tyler (The Creator) but takes it back soon after remembering how crazy Tyler’s life is and how much work it would involve.
He then choses Dill (Jason Dill, founder of Fucking Awesome) instead because he is rich, retired, and gets to relax all day."
"Talents? Um, I can play the theremin","The theremin is an electronic instrument played by the movement of a person’s hands in the air, which allows them to control both its volume and frequency. The theremin is known for its eerie, and off-putting sound, and was often used in science fiction films before being popularized by The Beach Boys after the instrument was used in their acclaimed song, “Good Vibrations”. This likely was no coincidence, as Ocean has reported in a 2013 interview with NME:

When I was making the first [album] there were a group of artists that I listened to, just for inspiration and to absorb the energies. It was a lot of Stevie Wonder, and this time it’s a lot of Beach Boys and Beatles and whatnot, so we’ll see how it trickles into the music and the final product. I can’t say much other than that.

The Beatles are credited in the tracks “White Ferrari” and “Seigfried” for the use of their melodies and samples. The theremin is used several tracks prior during the instrumental interlude of “Skyline To”."
"I wish I could sleep without, like, being dead
 But forever at the same time","These lines were widely attributed to Frank’s brother Ryan Breaux both on social media and on Genius in the wake of his untimely death at age 18. While Mikey Alfred’s interview with Breaux for Boys Don’t Cry magazine was included on the album, this line is from his interview with Evan Clark, a friend of Frank. Some of Clark’s answers from the interview are shown below:"
You say I’m changing on you,"Some of the people who Knew Frank before he legally changed his name and had critical Acclaim believe that he has changed as a person since he is becoming successful as he pursues his true passion, a career in music. In all honesty A lot of things have changed with Frank since 2009.


His Name
The Color of his hair
The amount of income that he’s now earning (Previously spoken of in this song)
His openness with his sexuality as he didn’t always Identify as bisexual.
What he does for a living
The Amount of Cars He now owns
And arguably what’s most important as well as what brought him his fame and fortune in the first place his music



Frank’s music has changed sonically as he’s grown older over these last four years. Blonde is a completely different sounding album compared to the lush and soothing more poppy, commercial, and accessible songs that are on his debut channel ORANGE. Frank’s new direction is almost Radiohead-like in the way that some songs are put together, this time around the songs are even more personal, dynamic, progressive and moody then ever before."
"You can change this track now, could’ve changed this bitch a long time ago","After tweeting briefly about the situation, Frank Ocean was mostly quiet about the entire altercation. He went on to still perform at the Grammys – bandaged hand and all – and received a standing ovation from everyone except Chris Brown when he won the award for Best Urban Complementary Album.



Since then, there has been a surprising turn of the cheek by Ocean, even though he didn’t back down during the actual altercation. Several artists such as Jay-Z and Adele, among others, took his side after the incident. Ocean has chosen again to make a ‘chess move’ and not play ‘fetch’ by continuously addressing the incident. This was actually one of the first times Frank publicly addressed the incident, and just like that he changes the “track” of the lyrics, deciding to go in a different direction on this “track”.

When Ocean sings that it could’ve been changed ‘a long time ago’, it may be a reference to Chris Brown and Frank Ocean’s 2011 Twitter feud, where Brown seemed to complimented Frank, comparing him to James Fauntleroy and Kevin Cossum, and Frank dissed back by comparing him to Ike Turner and Sisqo, who have histories of domestic violence, like Brown. Frank may feel that if he had not tweeted the petty clapback, the entire public ‘feud’ could have been avoided.

As mentioned in the previous line, Frank used to run track & field in high school, so he recognizes that changing tracks isn’t hard for him.

Unlike Frank, Ocean’s cousin started legal proceedings against Chris Brown who also fired back with a countersuit."
"Ain’t ran since track meets, that’s the only time I ran from a nigga","After their 2013 altercation, Frank Ocean stayed on the scene while Chris Brown left before the police arrived. That is why the LAPD considered Ocean the victim of the incident, even though no charges ever came of it.

Frank believes he’s come too far to try to back down, or run from anyone. This may explain why he got involved in the incident in the first place – some reports claimed that Ocean confronted Brown because someone in his entourage parked in Ocean’s parking spot and dissed Rihanna somewhere along the way, but other reports claim that the whole situation was initiated by Brown because Frank didn’t want to shake his hand . Either way, once it all began, Frank was not going to back down or walk away, because that’s exactly what people – Brown & company, and Frank’s haters – expect him to do (“this is chess now, not fetch”). Frank hasn’t run from anyone, figuratively and literally, except when he was an athlete in high school, and he wasn’t going to start again."
"Goddamn, fuck these lames, they don’t want none
 Fuck these lames, they don’t want none
 Fuck these niggas
 Fuck these niggas, they don’t want none
 Fuck these niggas
 Fuck you niggas and
 Fuck me if I hated on you","After a long talk with his momma about how far he’s come—from minimum wage jobs to 6-figure shows—Frank takes a moment to let his haters and naysayers know how he feels. With a bouncing barrage of F-bombs, incessant and stuttering, he makes his contempt be known, and he switches from the third person to second, now speaking to them directly. Not one to put himself above reproach, he closes with “fuck me if I hated on you” to let those lames know he can dish it out as well as he can take it."
"—know and —know, —know and —know","Frank’s staccato flow seems to be a result of words being bleeped out. On Frank’s reddit which (Malay reads) a theory regarding missing lyrics suggests references to Berghain/ The Booty Club have been omitted. A bunch of songs on the album do this, most notably “Nights”."
"Shit went one-eighty on me, please run that back, though","Frank’s life has completely changed since Nostalgia, Ultra but as he expresses in his magazine, his teenage years were some of the best years of his entire life. He seems to be grateful for his stardom, but he still catches himself reminiscing over the past.

Assuming this is all freestyle, he could also be kind of segueing into comments to the studio tech. In other words, “This didn’t go where I thought I was going with this, but play it back for me anyway.”

Another (vague) possibility is that this is a continuation of the message to Chris Brown: “This ‘track’ (conflict) wasn’t supposed to turn into a brawl, but here we are.  Come at me bro”…To support that, the intervening stuff about where Frank’s from could be interpreted as “we don’t fuck around where I’m from”."
"I’ma stick around
 I’m gon’ let my nuts hang","Frank lets the ‘lames’ he referred to before that he doesn’t plan to go anywhere – in fact, he’s going to be around more now than ever, essentially showing off to those that are envious/hating.

While this expression probably has no clear originator, it does echo Lil B’s “3 Stacks” (an inspirational track named after Ocean collaborator Andre 3000)

Everything is anything
And anything is everything
I don’t care, I let my nuts hang
For the whole world cos I’m back now

On his Tumblr, Frank mentions “Trading jewels and soaking in parables with the many-headed Brandon aka BasedGod in conversation” during the making of this album."
