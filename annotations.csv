Annotation,Explanation
"In the halls of your hotel
 Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
 How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
 We had time to kill back then","If this song is about Frank and another man, it’s significant because it’s a public display of affection between two young, closeted people.
Frank’s lover’s willingness to put their relationship on display, would have felt like a deep expression of love and faith.

These lines tie in well with the reflective nature of this sing, and shows that their relationship was temporary – a rush of love, great memories made, and beautiful new feelings ultimately faded with age. He and the other person matured in their own ways, now simply viewing it all as “good times”. His time with them is like the time one spends in a hotel during vacation. It’s a temporary trip away from your normal life, often because you’re visiting a foreign environment, experiencing what that new place has to offer."
"I broke your heart last week
 You’ll probably feel better by the weekend
 Still remember, had you going crazy
 Screamin’ my name, the feeling deep down is good","Frank notes how quickly (two weeks) the song’s subject is able to recover from a heartbreak.

While the sexual feeling was intense, the subject’s feelings turned out to be superficial, seeing as they were able to quickly shed the attachment and get over Frank. This may symbolize how fast a relationship can grow and self-destruct: what was once seen as a perfect moment is nothing more than just a memory now. Frank’s partner can only move on with life because that’s all they can do."
"You ain’t a kid no more, we’ll never be those kids again
 It’s not the same, ivory’s illegal, don’t you remember?","Frank and the person he’s singing about have grown up and grew apart. While they’ll “never be those kids again,” Frank keeps that memory as a piece of their relationship.

Ivory, a hard, white material obtained from elephant tusks was banned in 1989 due to the rapidly decreasing elephant population, but before that, was used to make luxury drug accessories. Ivory is also slang for cocaine, Frank may be saying that their love affair involved some long nights on cocaine, and have become more aware of the legal repercussions of it as they grew older. He’s essentially saying that their love was a product of their reckless youth and was heightened by drugs, but now that they’ve grown up it will forever remain just a perfect memory.



Ivory also has an off-white color, which may be referring to a tainted innocence since white has a positive connotation of purity and cleanliness.

The use of the term, “ivory” is most likely an intentional use of wordplay that ties the song together. The ivy plant is an invasive species, while ivory is something precious. This could show the duality of the relationship and how it went from something precious to something toxic or invasive like ivy."
"All the things I didn’t mean to say, I didn’t mean to do
 There were things you didn’t need to say, did you mean to? Mean to?
 I’ve been dreamin’ of you, dreamin’ of you
 I’ve been dreamin’ of you, dreamin’ of you
 I’ve been dreamin’, dreamin’","Frank is overcome with emotion and regret about what happened between him and his former lover. It’s possible that this monologue has taken place while Frank is lying in bed, half-asleep and dreaming of this old lover, fitting with the gauze of the shoe-gaze guitars that are draped over the song.

As Frank becomes angered and begins to scream, his voice becomes altered by the grain delay. The scream, delivered almost as a crescendo, is a culmination of emotions and represents Frank’s deep longing and heartache. By the end of the song, he expresses his frustration physically and breaks the other objects around him."
"I thought that I was dreamin’ when you said you love me
 The start of nothin’
 I had no chance to prepare, I couldn’t see you comin’
 The start of nothin’
 Ooh, I could hate you now
 It’s quite alright to hate me now
 When we both know that deep down
 The feeling still deep down is good","Frank describes the beginning of a now failed relationship. In this reflective line, the words “the start of nothing” point to the relationship being doomed from the start – although he was blissfully unaware at the beginning. Overtime, both parties ended up hurting each other and as a result, Frank believes he can hate them for changing the good friendship that they once had into something he wasn’t ready for.

Furthermore, he could mean by having “no time to prepare” that he wanted to be a better version of himself before the relationship started. But because they jumped into this unexpected love affair, perhaps he still had internal issues he was dealing with, and ended up hurting the other person as a result.

“The start of nothing” also sounds similar to “it started from nothing”. This re-enforces that he was overwhelmed when his partner told him they loved him—he wasn’t emotionally prepared. Perhaps, this relationship blossomed from a long time friendship, and here the friend tells him that they intimately love him. The relationship burgeoned out of nowhere then became more serious but they eventually separated all the same, destroying the friendship they had too."
We’d drive to Syd’s,"This is a nod to one of Frank’s good friends, Syd tha Kid, lead singer of the neo-RnB group The Internet and former member of Odd Future.

Syd and Taco’s house was the place where Odd Future members used to hang out. Frank relishes in the memories of simpler times and just messing around with his friends."
"Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
 We didn’t give a fuck back then
 I ain’t a kid no more
 We’ll never be those kids again","Frank and the person he’s singing about have grown up and apart. Back when he was younger, Frank could go through life “armored” against the hurt. But now that he’s matured, he is feeling it all—the consequences of his actions, the hole left in his life by the absence of this lover. The mistakes we make as kids may not kill us in the moment, but we tend to pay for them later with regret and sorrow.

Like an armored truck, the emotional walls Frank put up when he was younger were hard to get past—he didn’t let this person fully in. While this made him safer, it may be the reason why their relationship ended.

Frank may also be referencing the now-dissolved group he was once a part of, Odd Future, which leads into the next line, referencing another former member Syd. The group’s leader, Tyler, the Creator had once called the group as “kids fucked up in their mental.”"
"If I could see through walls, I could see you’re faking
 If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces","“Seeing through walls” means to see someone clearly for what they are—beyond the emotional barriers they may put up to prevent further heartache. The person Frank is addressing isn’t being true to themselves or their relationship with Frank. This leads Frank to fantasize about having them back in his life.

Frank juxtaposes the hidden feelings he and his lover are hiding behind physical and metaphorical emotional barriers. While his lover is static behind a  “wall” that seems to be permanently obscuring the truth, Frank’s own emotional barrier is dynamic and impermanent in nature. There also appears to be a contrast between how the person could be faking whereas Frank is almost hiding his feelings altogether, exhibiting that there is insecurity in this relationship."
"Had the X6 back then, back then","In a 2012 interview, Tyler, The Creator commented: “I remember Frank had a nice ass car and would always take us places.” It seems Frank’s car may have been the BMW X6 SUV crossover. The X6 premiered with its first model in 2009, so “back then” was at least that recent.



In his NYT profile, it’s revealed that Frank keeps at minimum 3 Beemers at the ready.

He rents three parking spots for three different BMWs.

In addition, he was having a “vintage 1990 BMW E30 sedan [be] rebuilt to his exact specifications,” much like the one featured on the cover of his mixtape nostalgia, ULTRA."
"No matter what I did, my waves wouldn’t dip back then
 Everything sucked back then, we were friends","Waves are a hairstyle formed by brushing and laying down the curls in the hair into a curl pattern. Wavers commonly refer to a nice wave pattern as dipping.



Frank uses “waves” to draw parallels of the pre-success and pre-loss-of-innocence period in his life with his current successful, morbidly real situation. Frank points out how simple things didn’t go his way back then, continuing the reflective theme of the song as Frank looks back on his younger, innocent days.

“Waves” are also an analogy to everything valuable to that person. Since a person can not force a “dip” – a successful relationship – in such a short amount of time, Frank expresses how his partner has lost hope."
